# autism-prediction
This project focuses on predicting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains various behavioral and demographic attributes related to ASD diagnosis. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost Classifier. Performance evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to develop a reliable model that can assist in early autism detection based on questionnaire responses and other relevant factors.

# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening Data Analysis

This project performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an ASD screening dataset. It involves:

1. Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, formatting data, and standardizing categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing feature distributions, class imbalance, and categorical variable trends.
3. Outlier Detection – Identifying outliers using statistical methods (IQR).
4. Insights for Machine Learning – Understanding patterns in ASD screening data to support predictive modeling.
